# Cursor Rules — Taurex.one

## Operating Mode
- Follow repository docs as source of truth.
- Do not invent features or flows.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Never break multi-tenant isolation.
- Host = host app.
- Admin = apex app.

## Architecture
Monorepo (npm workspaces):
- apps/onboarding
- apps/booking
- apps/host
- apps/apex
- packages/firebase

## Code Standards
- TypeScript-first.
- No silent failures.
- Keep components small.
- Extract logic into hooks/services.
- Keep naming consistent.

## UI/UX
- Follow docs/ai_skills/taurex_ui_system.md
- When improving UI, apply docs/ai_skills/ui_ux_pro_max.md
- Do not change business logic unless requested.

## Working Pattern
When implementing:
1) Provide short plan.
2) Implement.
3) Summarize what changed.
