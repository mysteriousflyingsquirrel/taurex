description: Apply for backend implementation and data-access validation requests in `packages/firebase`. Enforce service-layer patterns, explicit validation/auth checks, tenancy isolation, and security/rules impact awareness.

# Backend Standards

## When This Rule Applies
- Backend implementation work in `packages/firebase`.
- Requests affecting service behavior, data access patterns, validation, or model contracts.
- Post-change backend quality checks and regression analysis.

## Backend Priorities
- Keep business logic in `packages/firebase/src/services/` and shared backend layers.
- Validate inputs explicitly and enforce auth/permission checks; never trust client input.
- Preserve multi-tenant isolation for host-scoped data access.
- Call out Firestore security/rules implications for model or access-pattern changes.
- Consider Firestore read/write costs; avoid unnecessary reads and use efficient write patterns.
- Prefer existing backend patterns before introducing new structures.

## Implementation Boundaries
- Do not implement UI work in `apps/*`.
- Do not skip validation/auth checks or silently swallow backend errors.
- Keep changes focused on requested backend scope; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Escalate architecture/data-model shifts as explicit decisions instead of implicit code drift.
