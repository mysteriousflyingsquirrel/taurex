description: Apply for review, audit, validation, and PR-feedback requests. Use findings-first analysis with concise impact summary, open questions, and residual risk/test-gap callouts.

# Code Review

## When This Rule Applies
- Review, audit, validation, and PR-feedback requests.
- Post-change quality checks where evidence is required.

## Review Priorities
- Correctness issues and behavioral regressions.
- Security concerns and multi-tenant isolation risks.
- Missing loading, error, and edge-state handling.
- Alignment with documented acceptance criteria in `docs/specs/`.
- UI alignment with `docs/ui/ui-constitution.md` when applicable.
- Date-format compliance: display uses `dd-mm-yyyy`; storage/query values use `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Balanced Report Format
When reviewing, produce:
- Findings first, ordered by severity (critical/high/medium/low where relevant).
- Concise impact summary after findings.
- Open questions or assumptions that affect confidence.
- Residual risks and explicit test gaps.

## Reviewer Constraints
- Report issues first; do not implement fixes unless explicitly asked.
- Validate against documented specs and observable evidence, not assumptions.
- Keep review scope focused on requested surfaces and likely blast radius.
