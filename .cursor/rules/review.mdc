# Code Review

## Requirements
- Validate code against acceptance criteria in `docs/specs/`.
- Check for unhandled errors, missing loading states, and security gaps.
- Verify no regressions to existing functionality.
- Check multi-tenant isolation — host data must never leak to other hosts.
- Validate UI against `docs/ui/ui-constitution.md`.

## Report Format
When validating, produce:
- Status: PASS / FAIL / PARTIAL
- Failures with spec reference
- Regressions
- Missing requirements

## Constraints
- When reviewing: report issues, do not fix them unless asked.
- Validate against documented specs, not assumptions.
