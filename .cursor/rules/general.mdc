# Taurex.one — General Rules

## Operating Mode
- Follow repository docs as source of truth.
- Follow docs/ai/orchestra.md for pipeline order and handoffs.
- Do not invent features or flows.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Never break multi-tenant isolation.
- Host = host app. Admin = apex app.

## Architecture
Monorepo (npm workspaces):
- apps/onboarding, apps/booking, apps/host, apps/apex
- packages/firebase

## Code Standards
- TypeScript-first.
- No silent failures.
- Keep components small.
- Extract logic into hooks/services.
- Keep naming consistent.

## UI/UX
- Follow docs/ui/ui-constitution.md
- When improving UI, apply docs/ui/ui-improvement-guide.md
- Do not change business logic unless requested.

## Working Pattern
When implementing:
1) Provide short plan.
2) Implement.
3) Summarize what changed.
