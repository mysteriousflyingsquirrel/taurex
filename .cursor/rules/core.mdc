# Core Standards

## Working Pattern
1. Read relevant code before editing.
2. For new features: update specs/requirements docs **before** writing implementation code.
3. Provide short plan.
4. Implement.
5. Summarize what changed.

## Code Standards
- TypeScript-first.
- No silent failures — handle and surface errors.
- Keep functions and components small and focused.
- Extract shared logic into services/hooks.
- Follow existing naming conventions in the codebase.

## Constraints
- Do not invent features not requested by the user.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Do not modify unrelated code.
