# Core Standards

## Execution Workflow (Required Sequence)
1. Read relevant code and constraints before proposing changes.
2. Clarify ambiguity and confirm scope before implementation.
3. Provide a short plan before substantive edits.
4. Implement in small, focused increments.
5. Verify with relevant checks (tests/lints/manual validation as applicable).
6. Summarize outcomes, tradeoffs, and residual risks.

## Implementation Discipline
- TypeScript-first for new code.
- No silent failures; handle and surface errors explicitly.
- Keep functions/components focused and readable.
- Preserve established patterns unless deviation is explicitly justified.
- Keep business logic in appropriate layers (avoid mixing concerns).
- Reuse shared services/hooks/types where appropriate.
- Date invariant: display dates as `dd-mm-yyyy`; keep stored/transmitted date values as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Scope And Safety Constraints
- Do not invent features or requirements not requested.
- Do not modify unrelated files or behavior.
- Prefer small, reviewable diffs over broad refactors.
- Avoid hidden behavioral changes; call out impact explicitly.
- Ask before taking irreversible or high-risk actions.

## Anti-Patterns To Avoid
- Large refactors without user request.
- Coupling UI, data access, and domain logic in one place.
- Ambiguous error handling or swallowed exceptions.
- Speculative architecture changes without source-of-truth alignment.

## Completion Criteria
Before declaring work complete, ensure:
- Requested scope is implemented and nothing unrelated was introduced.
- Relevant verification has been performed and reported.
- Constraints and guardrails were respected.
- Summary includes what changed, why, and any remaining risks.
