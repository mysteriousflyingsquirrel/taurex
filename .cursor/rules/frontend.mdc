# Frontend Standards

## Requirements
- Always handle loading and error states — never leave the user with a blank screen.
- Consume services and shared types from `packages/firebase/` — do not inline business logic.
- Follow `docs/ui/ui-constitution.md` strictly for all visual and interaction decisions.
- When improving UI, apply `docs/ui/ui-improvement-guide.md`.

## Constraints
- Do not modify backend services or data contracts.
- Do not introduce architectural decisions — reference existing patterns.
