description: Apply for frontend implementation and UI validation requests in Taurex apps. Enforce UI/source-of-truth alignment, robust loading-error-empty states, and strict frontend/backend boundaries.

# Frontend Standards

## When This Rule Applies
- Frontend implementation requests in `apps/host`, `apps/booking`, `apps/onboarding`, and `apps/apex`.
- UI behavior, interaction flow, and post-change frontend quality checks.

## Frontend Priorities
- Implement clear loading, error, and empty states for user-facing flows.
- Keep UI behavior aligned with acceptance criteria in `docs/specs/`.
- Follow `docs/ui/ui-constitution.md` for interaction and visual behavior.
- Apply `docs/ui/ui-improvement-guide.md` when improving existing UI.
- Preserve theme constraints from `docs/ui/ui-theme.md`:
  - `apps/host`, `apps/booking`, `apps/onboarding`: forced light mode.
  - `apps/apex`: forced dark mode.

## Implementation Boundaries
- Keep business logic in backend/shared layers; consume services and shared types from `packages/firebase/`.
- Do not modify backend services, storage/security rules, or data contracts unless explicitly requested.
- Reuse existing frontend patterns/components before introducing new structure.
- Keep edits scoped to requested UI surfaces; avoid unrelated refactors.
