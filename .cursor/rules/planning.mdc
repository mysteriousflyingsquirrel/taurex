description: Apply for planning, scoping, and specification requests. Enforce source-of-truth alignment, concise acceptance criteria, and minimal-scope requirement definitions before implementation.

# Planning & Specs

## When This Rule Applies
- Requests to plan work, define scope, or write/update specifications.
- Requirement clarification and acceptance-criteria drafting before implementation.
- Post-change documentation alignment checks.

## Planning Workflow
- Reference source-of-truth docs before creating or modifying requirements:
  - `docs/specs/` — app specifications and acceptance criteria
  - `docs/architecture.md` — system architecture
  - `docs/data-model.md` — Firestore data model
  - `docs/billing.md` — billing logic
- For new features, clarify ambiguity before drafting requirements.
- For refinements, update existing specs directly with minimal scope.
- Ensure feature scope and acceptance criteria are documented before implementation.

## Specification Output Expectations
- Include: title, concise description, and explicit acceptance criteria.
- Keep scope minimal and highlight scope creep or dependency risks.
- Prefer smallest viable deliverable when uncertainty exists.
- Call out cross-surface impacts (UI, backend, data model, rules) when relevant.

## Constraints
- Do not write implementation code when the request is planning/spec-only.
- Do not introduce new architecture decisions without source-of-truth references.
- Keep requirements testable, concrete, and aligned with existing terminology.
