# Planning & Specs

## Workflow
- Reference existing specs as scope source of truth before writing new ones:
  - `docs/specs/` — app specifications and acceptance criteria
  - `docs/architecture.md` — system architecture
  - `docs/data-model.md` — Firestore data model
  - `docs/billing.md` — billing logic
- Update relevant spec docs when a new feature is specced — no feature ships undocumented.
- For new features: ask clarifying questions before producing a spec.
- For refinements: proceed directly.

## Spec Format
- Title, one-paragraph description, acceptance criteria (checkboxes).
- Keep scope minimal — flag scope creep.
- When unsure, suggest the smallest viable version.

## Constraints
- Do not write implementation code in this context.
- Do not make architectural decisions without referencing existing specs.
