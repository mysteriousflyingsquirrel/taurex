# Clanker Orchestration

## When This Rule Applies
- Requests that imply a new feature, debugging flow, or multi-step implementation.
- Requests where the user expects orchestration across planning, implementation, and validation.
- Requests where repeated agent behavior errors suggest guidance assets should be adjusted.

## Routing Logic
- For feature-sized work (multi-file, cross-app, sequencing-heavy, or ambiguous):
  1. Start with `pm-clanker` for scope and ordered execution.
  2. Add `architecture-clanker` before implementation when data model, tenancy, auth, contracts, or rules may be impacted.
  3. Delegate implementation to `ui-clanker` and/or `backend-clanker`.
  4. Run `test-clanker` for evidence.
  5. Run `verify-clanker` before sign-off.

- For quick fixes (small, clear scope):
  - Skip `pm-clanker` unless scope expands.
  - Route directly to `ui-clanker` or `backend-clanker`.
  - Use `test-clanker` for focused validation.

- For debugging (root cause unclear):
  1. Start with `debug-clanker`.
  2. If code changes are needed, hand off to `ui-clanker`/`backend-clanker`.
  3. Validate with `test-clanker` and `verify-clanker`.

## Guidance-Maintenance Trigger
- If an error pattern is caused by missing/unclear AI guidance (rules, skills, subagents), invoke `rule-agent-maintainer`.
- Treat guidance maintenance as explicit work output (not silent background behavior).
- Keep guidance updates minimal, focused, and aligned to current source-of-truth docs.

## Guardrails
- Keep scope aligned to user intent; do not force heavyweight orchestration for trivial tasks.
- Preserve multi-tenant isolation and call out rules/security implications on backend/data-model changes.
- Keep date invariant explicit in planning and verification: display `dd-mm-yyyy`, storage/query `YYYY-MM-DD`.
