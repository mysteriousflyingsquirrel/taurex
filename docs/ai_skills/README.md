# AI Skills (Cursor)

This folder contains reusable “skill prompts” that Cursor can apply.

## How to use
In Cursor chat, reference a skill explicitly:

- “Apply the skill: docs/ai_skills/ui_ux_pro_max.md to the Booking page”
- “Apply the skill: docs/ai_skills/testing_quality_gate.md to add tests for this module”

## Skills
- ui_ux_pro_max.md — UI/UX improvement framework
- taurex_ui_system.md — Taurex-specific UI system rules
